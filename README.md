## 📘 Overview

This project simulates a post-incident security remediation for a federal contractor (SWBTL LLC) following a Microsoft Azure cloud migration. It focuses on restoring security, governance, and compliance posture by implementing best practices in identity and access management (IAM), infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) configuration, data protection, and compliance frameworks.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Identify and remediate Azure access and resource misconfigurations
- Realign cloud architecture with **NIST 800-53**, **FedRAMP**, and **PCI DSS**
- Apply **Zero Trust** and **Least Privilege** principles via RBAC
- Establish secure, compliant cloud backup and recovery strategies
- Define shared responsibility and governance models using IaaS
